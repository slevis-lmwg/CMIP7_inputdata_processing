# This is a git submodule file with additional support for
#  git-fleximod (https://github.com/ESMCI/git-fleximod)
# 
#  The additional flags supported by git-fleximod are
#  fxtag - the tag associated with the submodule, this tag can be tested for
#          consistancy with the submodule hash using git-fleximod status
#          the hash can be updated to the tag using git-fleximod update
# 
#  fxrequired - indicates if a given submodule should be checked out on install
#               submoudules can be toplevel or internal and required or optional
#               toplevel means that the submodule should only be checked out if the
#               module is the toplevel of the git repo (is not a submodule itself)
#               internal means that the submodule is needed by the component whether
#               the component is toplevel or the submodule of another repo
#               required means that the submodule should always be checked out
#               optional means that the submodule should only be checked out if the
#               optional flag is provided to git-fleximod or the submodule name is
#               explicitly listed on the git-fleximod command line.
# 
#  fxsparse -   this is a path to a git sparse checkout file indicating that the
#               submodule should be checked out in sparse mode
# 
#  fxDONOTUSEurl    -   this field is used by git-fleximod test to insure that the url is pointing
#               to the official url of the repo and not to an unofficial fork.
#               It is intended for use of github workflows to test commits to protected
#               repository branches.
